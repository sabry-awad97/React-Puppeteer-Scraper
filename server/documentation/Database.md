# Documentation for the Database Class

## Overview

This is a Node.js module that defines a `Database` class using Mongoose, a popular Node.js ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB. The `Database` class is responsible for establishing a connection to a MongoDB database, saving records to the database, and closing the connection when necessary.

## Class Structure

### `Database` Class

The `Database` class has the following properties and methods:

#### Properties

- `connection`: A property that stores the Mongoose connection object.

#### Methods

- `constructor()`: A constructor that sets up event listeners for the database connection.
- `connect(dbName: string)`: A method that establishes a connection to the MongoDB database with the given name.
- `saveRecords(data: IRecord[])`: A method that saves records to the database.
- `disconnect()`: A method that closes the database connection.

### `database` Object

The `database` object is an instance of the `Database` class.

## Usage

To use this module in a Node.js application, you can import the `database` object and call its methods as needed. Here's an example usage:

```js
import database from './database.js';

// Connect to the database
await database.connect('myDatabase');

// Save records to the database
const records = [
  { name: 'John', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Mary', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 40 },
];
await database.saveRecords(records);

// Disconnect from the database
await database.disconnect();
```

In this example, we first connect to the `myDatabase` database using the `connect()` method of the `database` object. Then we save some records to the database using the `saveRecords()` method. Finally, we disconnect from the database using the `disconnect()` method.

## Event Listeners

The `Database` class sets up event listeners for the Mongoose connection object in its constructor. These event listeners are:

- `open`: Fires when the connection is established.
- `close`: Fires when the connection is closed.
- `disconnected`: Fires when the connection is disconnected.
- `reconnected`: Fires when the connection is reconnected.
- `fullsetup`: Fires when all servers in the topology are connected.
- `all`: Fires for all events.
- `error`: Fires when an error occurs in the connection.

These event listeners are mainly for logging purposes, so that we can see what's happening with the database connection in the console.
