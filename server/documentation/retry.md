# Documentation for function: `retry`

This code exports a function called `retry` that takes in a function as an argument, which returns a Promise. This function can be used to retry the execution of an asynchronous task if it fails, up to a maximum number of times.

## Parameters

- `fn`: a function that returns a Promise. This is the function that will be executed and retried if it fails.

Return Value:

- A Promise that resolves to the result of the successful execution of the input function.

## Behavior

- When `retry` is called, it will execute the input function and wait for it to complete. If the function completes successfully, `retry` will return the result of the function.
- If the function fails, `retry` will log an error message to the console, indicating the number of attempts that have been made, the error message, and the retry delay.
- `retry` will then wait for the specified retry interval (in milliseconds) before trying the function again. It will continue to retry the function up to a maximum of `retryCount` times.
- If the function has failed `retryCount` times, `retry` will throw an error indicating that the retry limit has been exceeded.

## Constants

- `retryCount`: the maximum number of times that the input function will be retried.
- `retryInterval`: the delay (in milliseconds) between each retry attempt.

## Usage

```js
const fetchResource = async () => {
  // implementation omitted for brevity
};

try {
  const result = await retry(fetchResource);
  console.log(`Resource fetched successfully: ${result}`);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Failed to fetch resource after multiple attempts: ${err}`);
}
```

In this example, `retry` is used to retry the `fetchResource` function if it fails, up to a maximum of `retryCount` times. If the function is successful, `retry` returns the result of the function call. If the function fails `retryCount` times, `retry` throws an error indicating that the retry limit has been exceeded.
