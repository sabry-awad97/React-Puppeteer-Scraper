# Summary

## Introduction

This is a Node.js server that provides a WebSocket connection to a client for scraping a website. The server uses the `express` library to serve static files, and `ws` to set up the WebSocket connection.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the server using `npm start` or `node index.js`. The server listens on `http://localhost:3000`. You can access the server by opening a web browser and going to `http://localhost:3000`. This will serve static files located in the `public` directory.

## WebSocket Connection

The server sets up a WebSocket connection using the `ws` library. The `setupWebSocket` function is responsible for setting up the WebSocket server and handling incoming messages. The WebSocket server is created using the `createServer` function from the `http` library. The WebSocket server is listening on the same port as the HTTP server, `3000`.

## Data Scraping

The server uses the `DataHandler` and `ParallelScraper` classes to scrape a website. The `ParallelScraper` class uses Puppeteer to launch multiple browsers and scrape multiple pages at once. The `DataHandler` class handles the data that is scraped from the website.

## Events

The `ScraperEvents` class is an `EventEmitter` that is used to emit events related to scraping. The `dataHandler` instance of `DataHandler` emits events related to data scraping. The `scraperEvents` instance of `ScraperEvents` listens for these events and emits them to the client over the WebSocket connection.

## WebSocket Messages

The client can send messages over the WebSocket connection to start scraping a website. The message should be in JSON format and have a `type` property and a `payload` property. The server listens for messages with the `type` property set to `"startScraping"`. When the server receives this message, it connects to a MongoDB database using the `database` module, and starts scraping the website using the `ParallelScraper` instance.

## Conclusion

This Node.js server provides a WebSocket connection to a client for scraping a website. The server uses the `express` and `ws` libraries to set up the server and WebSocket connection, respectively. The server uses the `DataHandler` and `ParallelScraper` classes to scrape a website, and emits events over the WebSocket connection to update the client on the status of the scraping. The client can send messages over the WebSocket connection to start scraping a website.
